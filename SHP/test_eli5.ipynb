So is there a technical reason why instead of charging stations for the cars, we don't have charging stations where you drop in, quickly pull out your battery and swap it with one that is already charged?      I understand that weight could be an issue, but if you divide it up into multiple batteries that weigh no more than say 20lbs each, that would be manageable and allow the average person to be able to change it out (or you could use attendants).
