      "Your body burns 2000 calories a day just for the very basic needs of survival and metabolism. If you are a man and you eat 2000 calories a day, your body burns 2000 calories a day just from breathing and digestion. If you are a woman, your body burns 2000 calories a day just from generating heat for the body. The difference is that a man burns the extra calories that are required to perform aerobic exercise. An aerobic exercise is any activity in which a person breathes faster and/or harder. It is a high intensity activity in which a person breathes faster and/or harder and is more strenuous. The average person burns around 2000 calories a day by just breathing and digesting. A man who burns an extra 2000 calories a day by exercising will burn roughly 2600 calories a day. A man who burns an extra 2600 calories a day by exercising will burn another 1500 calories in total. The average person burns an extra 1000 calories a day by exercising. The difference between the two is that a man will burn 1000 extra calories every day simply by exercising. This means that a man will burn an extra 500 calories a day by exercising. A woman will burn an extra 250 calories a day by exercising.\n"

Please direct all of those questions here: other threads will be deleted. Remember to **be respectful**. Rule 1 does not just apply to redditors, it applies to everyone. Regardless of anyone's personal feelings about her or the royal family, there are human beings grieving the loss of a loved one. Remember to **be objective**. Explain like I'm five years old is not the appropriate forum to discuss your personal feelings about the royal family, any individual members of the royal family, etc. Questions and comments should be about objective topics.

      "The Upshot-Knothole Grable (UKG) was a nuclear test carried out by the United States Army and the United States Navy in October 1946. The test was a nuclear detonation of an explosive device with a yield of approximately 100 kilotons of TNT. The explosion was so powerful that a large hillside was buried in ash, creating a giant mushroom cloud. The US Army deployed several cameras to the hillside in an attempt to capture visual images of the blast, but due to the intensity of the blast they were obliterated by the blast wave. The US Navy deployed several cameras to the hillside to capture visual images of the blast, but were obliterated by the blast wave.\n",

      "Laugh tracks were used on comedies from the 1950s until the late 1980s, when the popularity of sitcoms decreased due to the advent of home video and cable. It wasn't until 1984, when the videotape format became widely available to more households, that laugh tracks became standard on sitcoms. For the same reason as above. It was seen as a way to make sure that audiences were laughing at the jokes rather than just at the actors. Now that laugh tracks are the exception rather than the rule, they seem rather pointless.

      "If they could manufacture rain in Dubai last year for a heatwave, (link below,) why can't they do the same thing for the massive wild fires, droughts, & heat waves that we are seeing all over the world? Yes they actually manufactured rain in dubai. So if this capability exists -Why can't they do this to help the current droughts (like in France, for example?) More obviously, why can't they do this for wildfires? Is it financial? Is it a technological limitation or something? And if it is a technological limitation for whatever reason (atmospheric conditions, etc,) why aren't they working on this technology more? What are the limitations that are preventing methods (like what was done in Dubai,) from being implemented in other areas? idk i feel like this could save lives.

      "This is a really interesting question because it is closely linked to the aging of the brain in the sense that aging is part of the aging process. I think it is hardwired in biology to make decisions in a certain way for a very long time and then gradually become inflexible as you get older. The brain is built to adapt and change and this is the case for all species on earth and probably most other animals. Humans are a species of animals that are very resistant to change and this has been demonstrated in terms of the amount of time that it takes people to go from a certain vantage point to a very different one. There is some evidence for the existence of an instinctive brain (which is not always inflexible) but that would have to be studied in much more detail.\n",

      "Power grids are network of interconnected electrical networks that allow for the exchange of energy between consumers, utility companies, and the grid itself. Because power is generated by plants, it is fed into the power grid and can be returned by devices like solar panels or wind turbines. Each entity on the grid (power station, house, etc.) has a meter that indicates the amount of power flowing through that particular device or device segment. The meter also tells the grid when to turn on and off. Power plants constantly adjust production to meet the needs of the grid.

      "Islamic extremists are motivated by religious extremism and have taken advantage of these conditions to recruit, radicalize, and carry out attacks. Some believe that the Islamic religion, as a whole, is anti-Western, anti-Christian, anti-science, and anti-human, and this has led to the rise of Islamic fundamentalists. While Islam does promote peace, Muslims have a very strict interpretation of the Quran and have been able to cite verses to justify violence, and in some instances use it as a lynchpin. As such, these Muslims often do not fit into the rest of the Muslim world, and are often viewed as terrorists by the Western world.\n",

      "Harmonies sound good to our ears because we can associate them with emotional feelings like happiness and sadness. For instance, a harmonious song might make you feel happy because it has a melody with a tempo that matches the speed of your own heartbeat. Harmonies also make us feel good because they are like a companion. So a saxophonist might play a melody and then a violinist would play the same melody but slower. The violinist would be making a melody and a saxophonist would be playing a melody that was slower than his own.\n",

      "The brain only works if the rest of the body is also working. It works best if it's synchronized with your body. For instance, most people have body clocks that are synchronized with sunrise and sunset, but this isn't a requirement. If you wanted to wake up at 9 am, you would also have to go to bed at 9 pm the night before. This is because the body doesn't sleep, it is an activity. The body is programmed to awaken only when it has a specific task to complete. For example, you wake up to go to the gym. That task will occur at a certain time, 9 am. So you have to go to sleep at 9 pm if you want to wake up at 9 am. This is the only reason that you could wake up at exactly 9 am. But the brain can not distinguish between what is a task that is done, and just what has to be done. The brain can only differentiate between the two. This is similar to how you tell the difference between two numbers on a calculator: 1 + 2 = 5. You can tell the difference between 1 and 1 because you can use numbers and the number 5 to figure out the difference.\n",

      "The source of radiation is almost always the source, which is a piece of the source that is leaking and now gives off high-level radioactivity. The source is usually inside a building which also has a lot of drywall and plaster, so a lot of it gets sealed off from the outside, and the source is protected from people, as well as the rest of the house. The rest of the source is usually outside the house, in the wind and such. Then of course there is the issue of people being exposed to it as well. If it was a radioactive element like uranium which is highly radioactive, you would expect people near it would be exposed to high levels of radiation, but this isn't the case. The source of uranium is a big chunk of uranium rock which is a tiny bit of uranium inside the big rock. So even if uranium was leaking out, it would be extremely small amounts, and only a very small percentage of people are near the source.\n",

Similarly, banks have very strict rules governing how they manage their customer information, and use this information to build profiles of individuals and to make decisions. So, banks can use their power to restrict access to credit cards or to charge high fees for companies that use their services, even when the banks don't use them to earn money. However, with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, financial institutions no longer need to have the signature of a high ranking official in order to open an account. So, many institutions have been forced to change their practices, and can open a bank account for themselves without needing the signature of a high ranking official. Furthermore, they can also apply to have their names removed from the databases of those banks. Therefore, they can keep their identities private, and use the information they gather to be more efficient at a business.\n",
