      "    Response: While there is certainly the possibility of a wild animal dying of old age, death of animals due to old age is actually very rare. This is most apparent in the birds. The average lifespan of birds is the shortest of all the vertebrates, ranging between 1 and 3 years, yet they have an astounding and amazing method of reproducing themselves. Birds reproduce through a process called avian oogenesis. In this process, one of the mother’s eggs will be retained until the next season, when it will be released along with the unfertilized, reproductive egg. The two eggs will then both be fertilized, thus ensuring that there are two new birds to repopulate the species. These birds will thus reproduce by laying eggs from which the new generation will arise. So, while the birds have a very short life, each new generation lives on.\n",

      "    There are many unique organisms in the wild today that have adapted to survive to very great ages, such as the tortoise. However, tortoises are not a very common form of life in the wild. There is another organism, however, that lives a much longer life that is more common. The giant tortoise, which inhabits the Galapagos islands, can live on for 200 years. This is an incredible feat, and makes these animals unique. However, tortoises are not a very common organism in the wild, and are not actually native to the Galapagos. These species are thought to have arrived in the Galapagos by passing by on floating driftwood, and settling along the beaches. However, the most unique organisms of the Galapagos are the Galapagos penguins. \n",
      "    Penguins are a very interesting form of life that has adapted to certain extreme conditions. In fact, these animals are so adapted to their environments that they can actually die of heat exposure more easily than cold exposure. In temperate climates on land, a penguin may be exposed to a temperature of 32 degrees (Fahrenheit), with such conditions a penguin may be exposed to a temperature of 34 to 36 degrees (Fahrenheit). \n",

RC Helicopters are often flown inside of moving cars, although this can be hazardous if the car is moving too fast or too slow. RC Helicopters are also flown in front of moving cars at times, but this too can be hazardous to do. RC Helicopters, just like model planes, should NEVER be flown in a moving car or truck.\n",

Jackson was so sure of his victory that he did not send any of his army home. Jackson's army also contained a number of free blacks and Native Americans. Jackson believed the British to be a weak and cowardly enemy, and his army wasted no time in attacking. Jackson's men were equipped with muskets, cannons, and a variety of other weapons. Jackson was also well supplied with ammunition and provisions. Jackson divided his army into two groups. His main force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery would attack first. Jackson's secondary force would consist of his dragoons, infantrymen, and artillerymen. His dragoons were equipped with muskets, mortars, and cannons. Jackson planned his attack in such a way that his secondary force would distract the British, while his main force would launch its attack when the British were at its weakest.

The practice had numerous problems, but, in the end, most Royal children were healthy. Marrying your cousin or your niece was a common practice, and deformed offspring were no more common than those of any other group of people. Incestuous marriages can be traced back as far as the Bible, where King David’s wives are described as “his wives or concubines.” King James VI, for example, (also known as James I) was descended from Mary Tudor and Henry Tudor, via his mother Mary Queen of Scots. Incestuous marriages were commonplace until the 1800’s. royalty.org/tudor-dynasties-and-incestuous-marriages-royals-and-commoners. “Cousin or Niece Marriage. “\n",
